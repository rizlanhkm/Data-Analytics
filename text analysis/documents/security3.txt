Historically, cyber-attacks were labor-intensive, meticulously planned, and needed extensive manual research. However, with the advent of AI, threat actors have harnessed their capabilities to orchestrate attacks with exceptional efficiency and potency. This technological shift enables them to execute more sophisticated, harder-to-detect attacks at scale. They can also manipulate machine learning algorithms to disrupt operations or compromise sensitive data, amplifying the impact of their criminal activities.

Malicious actors have increasingly turned to AI to analyze and refine their attack strategies, significantly enhancing the probability of their success. These AI-driven attacks are characterized by their stealthy and unpredictable nature, making them adept at circumventing traditional security measures reliant on fixed rules and historical attack data. In the 2023 Global Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) Survey conducted by search firm Heidrick & Struggles, AI emerged as the most frequently recognized significant threat expected in the next five years. Consequently, organizations must prioritize raising awareness about these AI-enabled cyber threats and fortifying their defenses accordingly.

Characteristics of AI-driven cyberattacks
AI-driven cyberattacks exhibit the following characteristics:

Automated Target Profiling: AI streamlines attack research, utilizing data analytics and machine learning to profile targets efficiently by scraping information from public records, social media, and company websites.
Efficient Information Gathering: AI accelerates the reconnaissance phase, which is the first active step in an attack, by automating the search for targets across various online platforms, improving efficiency.
Personalized attacks: AI analyzes data to create personalized phishing messages with high accuracy, increasing the likelihood of successful deception.
Employee Targeting: AI identifies key personnel within organizations with access to sensitive information.
Reinforcement learning: AI utilizes reinforcement learning for real-time adaptation and continuous improvement in attacks, adjusting tactics based on previous interactions to stay agile and enhance its success rate while staying ahead of security defenses.
Types of AI-enabled cyberattacks
Advanced phishing attacks
A recent report from cybersecurity firm SlashNext reveals alarming statistics: since Q4 2022, malicious phishing emails have surged by 1,265%, with credential phishing seeing a 967% spike. Cybercriminals are utilizing generative AI tools such as ChatGPT to craft highly targeted and sophisticated Business Email Compromise (BEC) and phishing messages.

The days of poorly composed “Prince of Nigeria” emails in broken English are a thing of the past. Nowadays, phishing emails are remarkably convincing, mirroring the tone and structure of official communication from trusted sources. Threat actors utilize AI to craft highly persuasive emails, posing a challenge in distinguishing their authenticity.

To protect against AI-enabled phishing attacks:

Implement advanced email filtering and anti-phishing software to detect and block suspicious emails.
Educate employees about recognizing phishing indicators and regularly conduct phishing awareness training.
Enforce multi-factor authentication and keep software regularly updated to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
Advanced social engineering attacks
AI-generated social engineering attacks involve the manipulation and deception of individuals through AI algorithms to fabricate convincing personas, messages, or scenarios. These methods exploit psychological principles to influence targets into disclosing sensitive information or performing certain actions.

Examples of AI-generated social engineering attacks include:

AI-generated chatbots or virtual assistants are capable of human-like interaction, and they engage in conversations with individuals to gather sensitive information or manipulate their behavior.
AI-powered deepfake technology presents a significant threat by generating authentic audio and video content for impersonation and disinformation campaigns. Utilizing AI voice synthesis tools, malicious attackers collect and analyze audio data to accurately mimic the target's voice, facilitating deception in diverse scenarios.
Social media manipulation through AI-generated profiles or automated bots that spread propaganda, fake news, or malicious links.
Strategies to protect against AI social engineering attacks

Advanced Threat Detection: Implement AI-powered threat detection systems capable of identifying patterns indicative of social engineering attacks.
Email Filtering and Anti-Phishing Tools: Utilize AI-powered solutions to block malicious emails before they reach users' inboxes.
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Implement MFA to add an extra layer of security against unauthorized access.
Employee Training and Security Awareness Programs: Educate employees to recognize and report social engineering tactics, including AI-enabled techniques, through ongoing awareness campaigns and training sessions.
Ransomware attacks
The NCSC assessment examines AI's impact on cyber operations and the evolving threat landscape over the next two years. It highlights how AI reduces barriers for novice cybercriminals, hackers-for-hire, and hacktivists, enhancing access and information-gathering capabilities. This increased efficiency is already being leveraged by threat actors, including ransomware groups, in various cyber operations such as reconnaissance, phishing, and coding. These trends are expected to persist beyond 2025.

To defend against AI-enabled ransomware attacks:

Advanced Threat Detection: Use AI-powered systems to spot ransomware patterns and anomalies in network activity.
Network Segmentation: Divide the network to limit the spread of ransomware.
Backup and Recovery: Regularly back up critical data and verify restoration processes.
Patch Management: Keep systems updated to fix vulnerabilities exploited by ransomware.
Adversarial AI
Evasion and poisoning attacks are two types of adversarial attacks in the context of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models.

Poisoning Attacks: These involve inserting malicious data into the training dataset of an AI or ML model. The objective is to manipulate the model's behavior by subtly altering the training data, leading to biased predictions or compromised performance. By injecting poisoned data during training, attackers can undermine the model's integrity and reliability.

Evasion Attacks: These attacks aim to deceive a machine-learning model by crafting input data. The objective is to alter the model's prediction through subtle modifications to the input, causing it to misclassify the data. These adjustments are meticulously designed to remain visually imperceptible to humans. Evasion attacks are prevalent across different AI applications, such as image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

How to defend against adversarial AI:

Adversarial Training: Train the model to recognize adversarial examples using available tools for automatic discovery.
Switching Models: Employ multiple random models in the system for predictions, making it harder for attackers, as they are unaware of the current model in use.
Generalized Models: Combine multiple models to create a generalized model, making it challenging for threat actors to deceive all of them.
Responsible AI: Utilize responsible AI frameworks to address unique security vulnerabilities in machine learning, as traditional security frameworks may be insufficient.
Malicious GPTs
Malicious GPTs involve manipulating Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs) for offensive purposes, exploiting their extensive cyber threat intelligence. Custom GPTs, utilizing vast datasets, can potentially bypass existing security systems, leading to a new era of adaptive and evasive AI-generated threats. It should be noted that these are only theoretical at this point and have not yet been seen in active use as of the time of this writing.

WormGPT: used to generate fraudulent emails, hate speech, and distribute malware, serving cybercriminals in executing Business Email Compromise (BEC) attacks to influence recipients.
FraudGPT: has the capability to generate undetectable malware, phishing pages, undisclosed hacking tools, identify leaks and vulnerabilities, and perform additional functions.
PoisonGPT: Poison GPT is crafted to propagate online misinformation by injecting false details into historical events. This tool enables malicious actors to fabricate news, distort reality, and influence public perception.
Conclusion
AI-generated attacks pose a serious threat, capable of causing widespread harm and disruption. To prepare for these threats, organizations should invest in defensive AI technologies, foster a culture of security awareness, and continuously update their defense strategies. By remaining vigilant and proactive, organizations can better protect themselves against this new and evolving threat.
